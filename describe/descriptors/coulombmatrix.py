    """Calculates the zero padded Coulomb matrix.

    The Coulomb matrix is defined as:

        C_ij = 0.5 Zi**exponent      | i = j
             = (Zi*Zj)/(Ri-Rj)	     | i != j

    The matrix is padded with invisible atoms, which means that the matrix is
    padded with zeros until the maximum allowed size defined by n_max_atoms is
    reached.

    To reach invariance against permutation of atoms, specify a valid option
    for the permutation parameter.
