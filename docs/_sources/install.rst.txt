Installation
============
The package is compatible both with Python 2 and Python 3 (tested on 2.7 and
3.6). We currently only support Unix-based systems, including Linux and macOS.
The exact list of dependencies are given in setup.py and all of them will be
automatically installed during setup.

The latest stable release is available through pip: (add the *-\\-user* flag if
root access is not available)

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install dscribe

To install the latest development version, clone the source code from
github and install with pip from local file:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/SINGROUP/dscribe.git
    cd dscribe
    pip install .
