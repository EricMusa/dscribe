Installation
============
The package is compatible both with Python 2 and Python 3 (tested on 2.7 and
3.6). The exact list of dependencies are given in setup.py and all of them will
be automatically installed during setup.

To install the latest development version, clone the source code from
github and install with pip from local file:

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/SINGROUP/describe.git
    cd describe
    pip install .
